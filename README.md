# Graphic-Binary-Trees
A terminal program made to see binary trees graphically, made by Santiago De Andrade 07/2021 ( only available for Linux OS)

Usage:

Option 1: this option will run the program without initial random nodes

    gcc (instalation path)/main.c 
    
    ./a.out

Option 2: this option will run the program with an initial random nodes count 

    python3 (instalation path)/execute.py \n 


Note: if you run the program throuthout the second option, rememeber that the nodes count can not be grater than 30, there is no space in the screen xd)
