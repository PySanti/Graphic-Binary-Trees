# Graphic-Binary-Trees
    A terminal program made to see binary trees graphically. 
    All the code made by Santiago De Andrade 07/2021 ( only available for Linux OS).

Download:
        
    git clone  https://github.com/PySanti/Graphic-Binary-Trees

Usage:

Option 1: this option will run the program without an initial random nodes count

    gcc (instalation path)/main.c 
    
    ./a.out

Option 2: this option will run the program with an initial random nodes count 

    cd (instalation path)      
    python3 execute.py 
    Nodes : nodes_count

Note: if you run the program by the second option, consider that the nodes count cannot be greater than 30, it might not be space in the screen xd.

Note 2: yes, i made all the node-organitation algorith, the key is in the x position of each node, it can never be two nodes with the same position in the x axis .
